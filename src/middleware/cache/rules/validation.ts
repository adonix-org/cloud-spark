/**
 * Base class for cache validation rules.
 *
 * `ValidationRule` provides a standard mechanism for inspecting an outgoing response,
 * extracting a specific header (such as `ETag` or `Last-Modified`),
 * and applying cache validators from the incoming request.
 *
 * Subclasses implement:
 * - `getHeader()` to extract the relevant header from the response.
 * - `response()` to decide whether to return the response as-is,
 *   replace it with a conditional response (e.g., `304 Not Modified`),
 *   or return `undefined` to indicate the cached response is invalid.
 *
 * Rules derived from this class are typically used to implement
 * conditional GET handling and other validation-aware caching logic.
 *
 * @template H - The type of header value extracted from the response (e.g., `string` or `Date`).
