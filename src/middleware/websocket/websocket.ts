/**
 * Returns a middleware that validates incoming WebSocket upgrade requests.
 *
 * - Only validates the upgrade request; it does **not** perform the actual WebSocket upgrade.
 * - Ensures the request:
 *   - Uses the `GET` method.
 *   - Matches the specified path, supporting `path-to-regex` style patterns
 *     (e.g., `/chat/:name`).
 *   - Contains required WebSocket headers:
 *     - `Connection: Upgrade`
 *     - `Upgrade: websocket`
 *     - `Sec-WebSocket-Version` matches the expected version
 * - Returns an error response if validation fails, otherwise passes control to
 *   the next middleware or origin handler.
 *
 * @param path - The URL path to intercept for WebSocket upgrades. Defaults to `/`.
 *               Supports dynamic segments using `path-to-regex` syntax.
 * @returns A {@link Middleware} instance that can be used in your middleware chain.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * app.use(websocket("/chat/:name"));
 * ```
