/**
 * CORS Middleware Implementation
 *
 * Handles Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) for incoming requests.
 *
 * Behavior:
 * - Invokes the downstream middleware for all requests first by calling `next()`.
 * - If the request is an `OPTIONS` request (preflight), transforms the downstream
 *   response into a preflight CORS response.
 * - For other HTTP methods, applies CORS headers to the downstream response,
 *   unless the response explicitly opts out via `skipCors`.
 *
 * This ensures that all responses comply with the configured CORS rules
 * while still allowing downstream middleware to run for every request.
 *
 * @see {@link cors} for full configuration options and defaults.
